# RandomErasing
Random Erasing is a data augmentation method for training the convolutional neural network (CNN), which randomly selects a rectangle region in an image and erases its pixels with random values. In this process, training images with various levels of occlusion are generated, which reduces the risk of over-fitting and makes the model robust to occlusion.
